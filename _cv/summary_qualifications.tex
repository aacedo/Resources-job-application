\entrylocationstyle{I am a passionate social geographer that seeks to highlight the importance of Geographic Information Science (GIScience) to satisfy the pervasive demand for citizen social-spatial information at the city level. Specifically, I have been linked to the academic university research, where I have been developing and implementing frameworks and statistical methods, to understand the potential of GISc and its tools in achieving a better understanding of social theory, urban environments, civic engagement, open government, and citizensâ€™ perceptions. My current research studies the relationship between social theory, place, and space to operationalize their theoretical knowledge in order to solve problems in the urban domain. I am membership of the \href{https://uwaterloo.ca/civic-map-lab/}{\textit{Waterloo civic map lab}} and \href{https://lxnights.hypotheses.org}{\textit{LXnights}} research group. I am an enterprising person who loves challenges and does not give up easily. I also consider myself a decisive person, with good spirit and self-taught. I never stop learning at the same time that I strive to work in a team and foster collective values.}
