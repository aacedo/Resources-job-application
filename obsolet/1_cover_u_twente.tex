\begin{cvletter}
I write to show my keen interest in applying to the position as an Assistant Professor within the Faculty of Behavioural, Management and Social Sciences (BMS) the Department of Research Methodology, Measurement and Data Analysis (OMD). I have recently completed my PhD in Information Management from the Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Portugal), University of Münster (Germany), and Universitat Jaume I (Spain), as part of the GEO-C project (\url{www.geo-c.eu}), an H2020 ITN Marie Curie Skłodowska action. I have a MSc in Geomatics and two BScs in Statistics and Cadastral and Geodetic Engineering. I consider that my over ten years of academic and professional background experience conducting research and teaching, as well as supervising graduation projects in Statistics, Geoinformatics, and Geographic Information Science has prepared me well to tackle the challenges described as part of the job profile.\par
I am highly motivated by the University of Twente, due to its academic and research activity. I also find admirable its working environment and the possibility of professional growth that offers to its employees. On the other hand, it is interesting the role that the OMD has been performing and leading in the fields of research methods and statistics. Mainly, to provide insights regarding the design of the studies and the type of statistical analysis to diverse data sets. My previous experience has been strongly related to define and use statistical modelling for monitoring and predicting processes in several fields as transportation, public health, ecology, air pollution, agronomy, climate, cadastre, geodesy, remote sensing, and urban planning. In Colombia, I worked with the Colombian Corporation of Agricultural Research and the Colombian Oil Palm Research Centre developing data analysis to study relationships between soil properties and climate variables with crop yield and the distribution of plagues. My current work focuses on the use and analysis of data originated by new and massive data sources such as, e.g., social media, sensors, and telecommunication networks that require to rethink software tools, the architecture of systems, and methods of analysis to provide solutions in near real-time. I see contributing to your department with my experience in lecturing, researching, and statistical modelling. In this sense, I think my profile might provide instruments to formulate and develop projects in a very general framework that could cover from definition and design of systems to strategies of the data analysis.\par
From my point of view, my academic background is a particular combination that allows me to bring distinct and innovative conceptual elements to face the position of an assistant professor. I have profound knowledge in data analysis and, in particular, regression modelling, non-parametric statistics, design of experiments,  functional data analysis, multivariate time series, extreme value theory, spatio-temporal statistics, and  Bayesian hierarchical models, among others. I have advanced programming skills which can be seen in my management of R, SPSS, SAS, STATA, and SQL, which I acquired self-learning following my interest in always learning new things. All of the above has allowed me to carry out various positions in different roles, in which I have been able to demonstrate my competence. For instance, I have been the main lecturer at the undergraduate and graduate level in two major universities in Colombia for about eight years, teaching from basic to advanced subjects, around six different classes and between 100 and 140 students per semester. This role has required me to develop group management and communication skills, oral and visual communication tools, and the ability to coordinate multiple activities simultaneously, among others. My position as a lecturer has allowed me to work with students in the planning and development of their final bachelor and master projects. Together with my students, we have provided innovative analysis alternatives for many and varied phenomena. Concretely, I have promoted the use of statistics in the analysis and modelling of several fields of knowledge. Many of these works have been published in research journals and presented at conferences and symposiums. I believe that I am a person who has a robust capability to listen, interpret, and guide others. Moreover, I have worked in multidisciplinary teams in research centres and universities, coordinating, suggesting, and implementing data analysis. \par
It is my opinion that becoming part of your department would be highly rewarding. I believe that I can play a proper role in the activities that the position demands. I am willing to work with commitment, enthusiasm, and dedication to achieve the best results. In particular, I consider that I might propose research projects related to the use, analysis, and integration of data coming from several sources, to offer solutions to various problems giving answers to different types of users across several platforms.\par\bigskip

Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to future communications with you.
