\begin{cvletter}
I write to show my keen interest in applying to the position as Data Scientist Analyst (ID: 00424160). I have recently completed the joint doctorate degree in Information Management from the Universidade Nova de Lisboa (Portugal), University of Münster (Germany), and Universitat Jaume I (Spain), as part of the GEO-C project (\url{www.geo-c.eu}), an H2020 ITN Marie Curie Skłodowska action. I have a MSc in Geomatics and two BScs in Statistics and Cadastral and Geodetic Engineering. I consider that my over ten years of academic and professional background experience conducting statistical data analysis, consultancy, research, and teaching have prepared me well to tackle the challenges described as part of the job profile.\par
I am highly motivated with the type of company that is Accenture and its work in consultancy across several industries. I also find admirable its working environment and the possibility of professional growth that offers to its employees. Moreover, it is exciting the role the Accenture Digital in combining Artificial Intelligence and analytics to provide solutions to the complex challenges of its clients.\par
My previous experience has been strongly related to define and use statistical modelling for monitoring and predicting processes in several fields as public health, ecology, air pollution, agronomy, climate, transportation, cadastre, geodesy, remote sensing, and urban planning. I have been working with large, noisy, structured and unstructured datasets for various applications. For instance, I conducted the statistical data analysis of a project that aimed to identify and evaluate the effectiveness of a pharmacist-acquired medication history in an emergency department and its effect on reducing the potential adverse drug events. I have also been studying the spatio-temporal behaviour of various diseases such as dengue, malaria, and gastric cancer, through Bayesian regression modelling to establish several factors associated with the distribution of the number of cases across space and time. Furthermore, I have been working in modelling population dynamics of several species and its relationships with environmental factors. Correctly, I estimated count regression models to explain the weekly number of catches males of Spodoptera Frugiperda, using sexual pheromones, in two different areas as a function of the food supply in the space. Later, I developed an endemic - epidemic approach based on a branching process to predict the number of caught of Anthonomus Grandis in insect traps in cotton growth fields to establish adequate strategies of pest control. I worked with the Colombian Corporation of Agricultural Research and the Colombian Oil Palm Research Centre developing data analysis to study relationships between soil properties and climate variables with crop yield and the distribution of plagues. During my doctorate, my work was on the study of the urban human dynamics (human activity and human mobility) implementing statistical techniques on datasets coming from social media data, sensors, and telecommunication networks. Also, I have developed various projects that aimed to analyse the spatial behaviour of multiple processes that occur in the earth such as subsidence, rainfalls distribution, gravimetric and magnetic fields, among others by using Bayesian methods for predicting and defining optimal spatial sampling designs. I studied the distribution of air pollutant (particulate matter 2.5) in Bogota, Colombia, using functional data analysis over the collected data in monitoring stations across the city, the work aimed to understand the spatio-temporal patterns in the distribution of those particles.\par
My current work focuses on the use and analysis of data originated by new and massive data sources such as, e.g., social media, sensors, and telecommunication networks that require to rethink software tools, the architecture of systems, and methods of analysis to provide solutions in near real-time. I see contributing to your company with my experience in consultancy, researching, and statistical modelling. In this sense, I think my profile might provide instruments to formulate and develop projects in a very general framework that could cover from definition and design of systems to strategies of the data analysis.\par 
From my point of view, my academic background is a particular combination that allows me to bring distinct and innovative conceptual elements to face the position of a data scientist analyst. regression modelling, non-parametric statistics, design of experiments,  functional data analysis, multivariate time series, extreme value theory, spatio-temporal statistics, and  Bayesian hierarchical models, among others.  I have advanced programming skills which can be seen in my management of R, SPSS, SAS, STATA, and SQL, which I acquired self-learning following my interest in always learning new things. All of the above has allowed me to carry out various positions in different roles, in which I have been able to demonstrate my competence. For instance, I have been the main lecturer at the undergraduate and graduate level in two major universities in Colombia for about eight years, teaching from basic to advanced subjects, around six different classes and between 100 and 140 students per semester. This role has required me to develop group management and communication skills, oral and visual communication tools, and the ability to coordinate multiple activities simultaneously, among others. My position as a lecturer has allowed me to work with students in the planning and development of their final bachelor and master projects. Together with my students, we have provided innovative analysis alternatives for many and varied phenomena. Concretely, I have promoted the use of statistics in the analysis and modelling of several fields of knowledge. Many of these works have been published in research journals and presented at conferences and symposiums. I believe that I am a person who has a robust capability to listen, interpret, and guide others. Moreover, I have worked in multidisciplinary teams in research centres and universities, coordinating, suggesting, and implementing data analysis. \par
It is my opinion that becoming part of your analysts team would be highly rewarding. I believe that I can play a proper role in the activities that the position demands. I am willing to work with commitment, enthusiasm, and dedication to achieve the best results.\par
Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to future communications with you.\par
