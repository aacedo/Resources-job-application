\begin{cvletter}
%\lettersection{About Me}
I am Luis Fernando Santa Guzman, a Colombian statistician and cadastral and geodetic engineer with MSc in Geomatics, and PhD in Information Management from the Universidade Nova de Lisboa in the joint doctorate program of Geoinformatics, H2020 Marie Curie Skłodowska action - GEO-C project (\url{www.geo-c.eu}). I consider that my over ten years academic and professional background experience conducting research and teaching, as well as supervising graduation projects in Statistics, Geoinformatics, and Geographic Information Science has prepared me well to tackle the challenges described as part of the job profile. Furthermore, I would like to express my keen interest in the position as a Post-Doc at UFZ.\par
I am highly motivated by the research units and the intregrated projects at UFZ. My previous experience has been strongly related to the use of spatio-temporal statistics for monitoring and predicting processes in several fields as agronomy, climate, ecology, air pollution, transportation, public health, cadastre, geodesy, remote sensing, and urban planning. In Colombia, I worked with the Colombian Corporation of Agricultural Research and the Colombian Oil Palm Research Centre developing data analysis to study relationships between soil properties and climate variables with crop yield and the distribution of plagues. My current work focuses on the use and analysis of spatio-temporal data originated by new and massive data sources such as social media, sensors, and telecommunication networks that require to rethink software tools, the architecture of systems, and methods of analysis to provide solutions in near real-time. I see myself contributing to your Centre with my experience and knowledge in statistical data analysis. In this sense, I think my profile might provide instruments to develop the project in a very general framework that could cover from 
systems definition and design to the strategy of data analysis.\par
From my point of view, my academic background is a particular combination that allows me to bring distinct and innovative conceptual elements to face the position of a post-doc. I have profound knowledge in data analysis and, in particular, spatio-temporal prediction using tools from geostatistics, functional data analysis, multivariate time series, extreme value theory, and  Bayesian hierarchical models, among others. I have advanced programming skills which can be seen in my management of R, QGIS, and SQL, which I acquired by catalysing self-learning my interest in always learn new things. On the other hand, I have carried out various positions in different roles, in which I have been able to demonstrate my competence. For instance, I have been the main lecturer at the undergraduate and graduate level in two major universities in Colombia for about eight years, teaching from basic to advanced subjects, around six different classes and between 100 and 140 students per semester. This role has required me to develop group management and communication skills, oral and visual communication tools, and ability to coordinate multiple activities simultaneously. My position as a lecturer has given me the opportunity to work with students in the planning and development of their final bachelor and master projects. Together with my students, we have provided innovative analysis alternatives for multiple and varied phenomena that occur on the earth's surface. Many of these works have been published in research journals and presented at conferences and symposiums. I believe that I am a person who has a robust capability to listen, interpret, and guide others. \par
It is my opinion that becoming part of your research team would be highly rewarding. I believe that I can play a proper role in the activities that the position demands. I am willing to work with commitment, enthusiasm, and dedication to achieve the best results.\par
Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to future communications with you.\par
Sincerely,\par
{\bf Luis F. Santa G.}
